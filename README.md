UR5 Robot Sequential Assembly Simulation

MATLAB Robotics Toolbox Project
Overview

This project simulates the sequential positioning of the UR5 robotic arm for an assembly-line task, leveraging MATLAB and the Peter Corke Robotics Toolbox. The simulation models the UR5 robot's ability to move precisely through a series of predefined waypoints representing real-world assembly actions (component pickup, inspection, assembly, and placement).
Features

    Full UR5 Kinematic Modeling:
    Robot structure defined via Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) parameters.

    Waypoint Definition:
    Joint-space configurations for four key assembly task positions.

    Forward & Inverse Kinematics:
    Calculation and verification of end-effector poses and joint angles at each waypoint.

    Trajectory Planning:
    Smooth, collision-free joint-space paths generated using cubic interpolation (jtraj).

    3D Visualization:
    Detailed MATLAB plots showing robot posture, joint labels, waypoints, and interpolated trajectory.

    Performance Evaluation:
    Numerical analysis of end-effector accuracy at each task phase.

Usage

    Requirements:

        MATLAB R2020a or later

        Peter Corke’s Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB

    Run the Simulation:

        Open the UR5_Assembly_Simulation.mlx Live Script in MATLAB.

        Step through each section to visualize robot setup, kinematics results, and trajectory planning.

    Outputs:

        The script prints DH parameters, joint angles, transformation matrices, and accuracy results in the command window.

        3D plots and trajectory animations are displayed.

        End-effector errors at each waypoint are computed and reported.

Project Structure

    Robot Modeling:
    Includes DH parameterization and SerialLink model creation.

    Task Definition:
    Physical interpretation and code definition of waypoints.

    Kinematic Analysis:
    Implementation of both FK and IK with validation.

    Trajectory Generation:
    Explanation and MATLAB code for smooth motion between waypoints.

    Visualization:
    3D plot generation with labeled joints, waypoints, and paths.

    Performance Analysis:
    Quantitative evaluation of positioning accuracy and discussion of simulation results.

Notes

    In simulation, end-effector errors are virtually zero. Real-world implementations may experience small deviations due to hardware limitations.

    The simulation code is extensible for additional constraints (e.g., collision avoidance, dynamic limits).
